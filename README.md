# Simon-Game-Challenge

- This is a game challenge on how long sequence can player remember.
- There are four coloured button each having different sound given to them.
- At first the system plays one sound and highlights the corresponding coloured button.
- The user has to click on the button to which the sound belongs to (basically the button which was highlighted).
- After that the system plays another sound and highlights button corresponding to that sound.
- Now the user has to play the whole sequence which the system played before playing the last sound and then play the last sound. In short the player is required the sequence from the beginning of which sound was played.
